# Voice-playground
Playground repository where I will learn and try to explain how voice services works and how you can code things around them.


## Idea
The idea of this project is to motivate myself to learn more about VoIP area and at the same time provide my findings to anyone else who finds out this repository.

The main language for the coding part of this project will be a GoLang.
