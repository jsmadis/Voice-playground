# Asterisk
This folder will be used to demonstrate and try out different things from the [Asterisk](https://www.asterisk.org/).


## Usage
For the easy usage I will be using docker image that contains asterisk software. Luckily this is already done by [andrius/asterisk](https://hub.docker.com/r/andrius/asterisk/#!).


## Folders

### Default-files
This folder will contain default files that are generated by Asterisk. Those files contains configuration and documentation for the configuration. We will be referencing them in this playground.

#### Asterisk-etc
This folder contains all files generated by asterisk 20.5.2 version which are stored in the /etc/asterisk folder in the docker container of a fresh instalation.
