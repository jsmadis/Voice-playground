# Asterisk
This folder will be used to demonstrate and try out different things from the [Asterisk](https://www.asterisk.org/).


## Usage
For the easy usage I will be using docker image that contains asterisk software. Luckily this is already done by [andrius/asterisk](https://hub.docker.com/r/andrius/asterisk/#!).
